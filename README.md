# DeepAntiCheat (DLAC)
A Bukkit plugin for detecting safe(ghost) hackers in Minecraft servers with deeplearning.     
Cheating and anti-cheating both are ways of playing Minecraft, **but** none of them can be missing.

## Todo: 
1. Players combat data collector.
2. Reach feature.

## Not work at present, in development.

## Some classes was created before development. 
This is no problem , I always create most of the classes during the programming design phase.
